# Testing
## W3

- I conducted automated testing using the W3 HTML checker, this displays any syntax errors within the HTML code, I ran it on each page and then went through and fixed each error one by one, until the validator produced no errors. This required me to run it several times until it was error free.

## Audits / Chrome Dev Tools
- I used Chrome Dev Tools to run audits on the performance, accessibility and best practices on the website for both mobile and desktop layouts. I then took on board the feedback and made changes to my website where necessary in order to achieve higher scores. I came to the conclusion some of the advice around accessibility would have hindered the design of the website so I made improvements where I could without majorly affecting the current design, as per my client's request.
